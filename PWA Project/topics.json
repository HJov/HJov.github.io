      "description": "Our home planet, Earth, is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbor life. About 71% of Earth's surface is water-covered, with oceans constituting most of this water. Its atmosphere consists primarily of nitrogen and oxygen, and it has a powerful magnetic field generated by its molten outer core. Earth orbits the Sun at an average distance of about 93 million miles, completing one orbit every 365.25 days. Its single natural satellite, the Moon, is the fifth-largest moon in the Solar System.",

      "description": "Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System. Mars is often called the 'Red Planet' due to its reddish appearance, which is caused by iron oxide (rust) on its surface. The planet has a thin atmosphere primarily composed of carbon dioxide. Mars has two small moons, Phobos and Deimos, which may be captured asteroids. Mars has polar ice caps made of water and carbon dioxide ice, and evidence suggests that liquid water may still flow on the planet's surface. Mars is currently the most explored planet beyond Earth, with multiple rovers and orbiters studying its surface and atmosphere.",

      "description": "The Hubble Space Telescope is a space telescope that was launched into low Earth orbit in 1990 and remains in operation. It's one of the largest and most versatile space telescopes and has been instrumental in numerous astronomical discoveries. Named after astronomer Edwin Hubble, it was built by NASA with contributions from the European Space Agency. Hubble's position above the atmosphere provides it with a view unobscured by atmospheric distortion. The telescope has undergone several servicing missions to repair and upgrade its systems, allowing it to continue operating decades beyond its planned lifespan.",

      "description": "A black hole is a region of spacetime where gravity is so strong that nothing‚Äîno particles or even electromagnetic radiation such as light‚Äîcan escape from it. The boundary of the region from which no escape is possible is called the event horizon. Black holes form when very massive stars collapse at the end of their life cycle. Supermassive black holes exist at the center of most galaxies, including our own Milky Way. In 2019, the Event Horizon Telescope collaboration released the first direct image of a black hole, specifically the supermassive black hole at the center of galaxy M87.",

The station serves as a laboratory for scientific research in microgravity. The ISS maintains an orbit with an average altitude of 248 miles (400 km) above Earth. It travels at a speed of about 17,500 mph (28,000 km/h), completing one orbit every 90 minutes.

Jupiter has at least 79 moons, with the four largest, known as the Galilean moons (Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto), being discovered by Galileo Galilei in 1610.

Nebulae are often star-forming regions where dense concentrations of gas and dust collapse under their own gravity to form stars. Some nebulae come from the gas and dust thrown out by the explosion of a dying star. There are several different types of nebulae, including emission nebulae that glow with their own light, reflection nebulae that reflect the light of nearby stars, dark nebulae that appear as dark patches against brighter backgrounds, and planetary nebulae formed from the outer layers of a dying star.",

The Apollo spacecraft consisted of three parts: the Command Module (CM), the crew's quarters and flight control section; the Service Module (SM) for propulsion and spacecraft support systems; and the Lunar Module (LM) for landing on the Moon. The program was driven by President John F. Kennedy's goal of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to Earth before the end of the 1960s, which was accomplished with the Apollo 11 mission.",
